# ZombieKudan
Its a simple zombie game using the KUDAN library.
It does not need a marker like the Vuforia library. You need to get the tools in the Kudan website to properly set and make a marker.
The game simply renders a simple Zombie prefab onto a surface, when clicked Start.

You can shoot the zombie using Fire button. Zombie again renders in a new position.

--Make sure the surface you want to augment on is flat and simple coloured.
